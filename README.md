# Whole genome sequence analysis for donor-recipient pairs


The first part scripts for the project are available here: https://github.com/hhuang2018/WGS_analysis

This  contains the whole genome sequence analysis pipeline, IBD test and other statistical tests.

This repository contains only "gene-gene interaction" project, and still under development.

The final version of the scripts will be merged into one repository, and is set to release by the end of 2018.
